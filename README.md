# Vendace habitat analysis during summer stratification 

This repository contains code from the programming part of my BSc thesis project in Bioscience at the University of Skövde. The project analysed Vendace habitat during the summer when the habitat volume was at it´s lowest during a five year period.  


## Project Aim

The aim of this project was:

To calculate and visualise Vendace habitat during the most stressed measuring occasion over a five year period.


## Repository Contents

This repository contains the following files:

- `README.md`: This file, which provides an overview of the project.
- `Clean_and_qualitycheck_BCs/`: Contains the code used to qualitycheck and clean the data in R.
- `Functions_BCs/`: Contains the code for the functions that was created and used in R.
- `Analysis_BCs/`: Contains the code for analysis in R.
- `QGIS_Reclassify_Görveln_BCs/`: Contains the code for reclassification of the station Görveln in QGIS.
- `QGIS_Reclassify_Skarven_BCS/`: Contains the code for reclassification of the station Skarven in QGIS.


## Observe! 

The code in this repository is the basis for the examiner to review my thesis. The R-code is specific to this project but a package will be created for general use this summer (2023).
